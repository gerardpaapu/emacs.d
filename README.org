* My Emacs Setup

  This is my emacs config for work at Xero

** Packages

   My config relies on package.el which is included in the Emacs
   distro as of v24. It should be able to fetch and install all the
   packages it uses, each customization file installs its own packages.

** ./platform
   
   Platform specific configuration

** ./customizations

   Customizations broken up into modules for the modes or aspects that
   they customize e.g. customizations/js-custom.el is customizations
   for editing javascript and json. Some of it very specific to
   javascript at Xero.
