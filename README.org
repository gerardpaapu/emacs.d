* My Emacs Setup

  This is my emacs config for work at Xero

** ./platform
   
   Platform specific configuration

** ./customizations

   Customizations broken up into modules for the modes or aspects that
   they customize e.g. customizations/js-custom.el is customizations
   for editing javascript and json. Some of it very specific to
   javascript at Xero.
